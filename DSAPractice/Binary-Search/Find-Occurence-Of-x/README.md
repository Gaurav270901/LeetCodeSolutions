ðŸ“š Problem: Find First and Last Occurrence of a Number in a Sorted Array
Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array containing N integers and an integer X.
Your task is to find the first and last occurrence of X in the given array.

If X exists, output its first and last index.

If X does not exist in the array, output {-1, -1}.

Note: Array indexing is 0-based.

Input
An integer N â€” the size of the array.

An array arr of N integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

An integer X â€” the element whose first and last occurrences need to be found.

Output
A pair of integers representing the first and last index of X.

If X is not present, output {-1, -1}.

Constraints
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^5

-10^9 â‰¤ arr[i], X â‰¤ 10^9 (for all 0 â‰¤ i < N)
